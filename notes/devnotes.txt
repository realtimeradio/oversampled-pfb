Q: single/dual-port definitions
Am I misunderstanding what it means to be sp, dp and true dp? I thougt that true
dp would give me two reads and two writes that I could enable independent of
eachother... I must be wrong? Because I don't see a inference template that
provides that... If this is true. What does this mean for my design...?

Q: memory collisions
I understand what a memory colission is and that they are bad but I am having a
hard time knowing when that will for sure be an issue. For example, I know there
is a WAR mode for the BRAM. This indicates to me that the BRAM will read the
value first and then write. This would then allow that the read address pointer
and the write address pointer can point at the same spot in the same cycle.
However I do not know or understand the limitations on ports. For example, if my
design synthesizes to using two ports but the write is on one port and the read
is on the other will this actually then result on a collision?

Q: Control architecture
Another question is with how to handle the control structure. Should there be
internal statemachines that are creating the control or should it be dependent
on the upstream AXIS interface? We came up with arguments for both. Since the
faster sample rate is a rational multiple of the lower clock rate (data clock)
then there is still this synchronous nature for how everything works. However,
only relying on the AXIS on the input provides reliability issues. We need the
AXI stream interfaces anyway and so for now I am thinking I will implement both
and use them as a reliability measure and just see what drops out of the
simulations as time goes on.
